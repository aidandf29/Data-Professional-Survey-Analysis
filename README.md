# Data Professional Survey Analysis: Insights into Roles, Salaries, and Career Paths

## Project Overview

This project analyzes survey data from data professionals across various roles and industries. The dataset consists of 630 responses and includes information on job titles, career switches, salaries, industries, tools used, challenges faced, preferences, demographics, and more.

### Data Summary:
- **Total Rows:** 630
- **Total Columns:** 28
- **Key Columns:**
  - **Unique ID:** Unique identifier for each respondent.
  - **Email:** Respondent's email address.
  - **Date Taken:** Date the survey was taken.
  - **Time Taken:** Time the survey was taken.
  - **Survey Questions (Q1 - Q13):** Various questions covering roles, careers, salaries, industries, tools, challenges, preferences, gender, age, country, education, and ethnicity.

### Observations:
- Some columns such as **Browser**, **OS**, **City**, **Country**, and **Referrer** have no data.
- The **Date Taken** and **Time Taken** columns may need to be converted to datetime format for further analysis.
- Sensitive columns like **Email** should be anonymized or removed for public sharing.

### Potential Analyses:
1. **Role and Salary Analysis:**
   - Identify the distribution of roles in the data field and the relationship with salary.
   
2. **Career and Education Analysis:**
   - Explore how educational background influences career transitions into data roles.
   
3. **Demographic Analysis:**
   - Analyze the distribution of gender, age, and ethnicity among data professionals.

4. **Visualizations:**
   - Create visualizations to illustrate the distribution of roles, salaries, industries, and job preferences.

### Data Cleaning, EDA, and Visualization:
I have performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to ensure the quality and reliability of the dataset. Additionally, I have created sample visualizations using Power BI to present insights visually. Below is the raw dataset and visualizations, ready for further analysis.
